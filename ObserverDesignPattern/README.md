### Observer Design Pattern
It is a design pattern that notifies other objects of these changes when there is any change in the state of the existing object. To be more precise, when an update, change or realization of a certain condition occurs in the "y" property of the "x" object, other "z", "w", "k" vs. The system that notifies the objects of this new state is called.

The classic example is financial transactions (stockbrokers are notified when the value of a share changes)
